write a few sentences for me

<ANSWER>
Here are a few sentences for you:

The morning sun cast long shadows across the quiet street, painting everything in warm golden hues. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the old oak tree, carrying with it the sweet scent of blooming jasmine. In the distance, the sound of children's laughter echoed from the nearby park, reminding everyone that summer had finally arrived.

show me some markdown!

[2026-01-15T22:17:02-06:00] === LLM Response ===
<ANSWER>
Here's some markdown for you to see in action:

# This is a Main Header

## This is a Subheader

**This text is bold** and *this text is italic*.

Here's a list:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with **bold text**

And a numbered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

> This is a blockquote - great for highlighting important information!

Here's some `inline code` and a code block:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Markdown is awesome!"
```

You can also create [links](https://www.example.com) and add horizontal rules:

Pretty neat, right? Markdown makes formatting text simple and readable!
